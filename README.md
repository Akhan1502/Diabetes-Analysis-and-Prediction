# Diabetes-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project involves data analysis and prediction of diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. It provides insights into the data through visualizations and builds a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient information.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable prediction model that aids in the early diagnosis of diabetes. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the system processes the provided diagnostic measurements to classify patients into diabetic or non-diabetic categories.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations.
- Correlation heatmaps to identify feature relationships.
- Logistic Regression model for diabetes prediction.
- Model evaluation with accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- Save and export trained model for future predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases** and contains 768 entries with 8 numerical features and a binary target variable. All patients are females, at least 21 years old, and of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset includes the following variables:

- **Pregnancies**
- **Glucose**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Skin Thickness**
- **Insulin**
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
- **Age**
- **Outcome**: Target variable indicating diabetes presence (1) or absence (0)

## Results
The developed Diabetes Prediction System demonstrates promising accuracy and reliability in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes. 

## Development
This project was developed under the **Meriskill Internship** for **4 months**. During this time, the key tasks included data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation using various machine learning techniques.

## Files Included
- **dataset.csv**: The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset used for analysis and model training.
- **diabetes_prediction_model.pkl**: The trained machine learning model, ready for future predictions.
- **diabetes_analysis_visualisations.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis and steps for diabetes prediction.
- **diabetes_prediction.py**: Python script for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
